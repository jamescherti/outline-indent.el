The **outline-indent** Emacs package provides a minor mode that enables code folding based on indentation levels.

The **outline-indent** package is a fast and reliable alternative to the **origami.el** and **yafolding.el** packages. (*origami.el* and *yafolding.el* are no longer maintained, slow, and known to have bugs that impact their reliability and performance.)

In addition to code folding, *outline-indent* allows:
- moving indented blocks up and down with `(outline-indent-move-subtree-up)` and `(outline-indent-move-subtree-down)`,
- indenting/unindenting to adjust indentation levels with `(outline-indent-shift-right)` and `(outline-indent-shift-left)`,
- inserting a new line with the same indentation level as the current line with `(outline-indent-insert-heading)`,
- Move backward/forward to the indentation level of the current line with `(outline-indent-backward-same-level)` and `(outline-indent-forward-same-level)`.
- Customizing the ellipsis to replace the default "..." with something more visually appealing, such as "▼".
- and other features.

The *outline-indent* package uses the built-in *outline-minor-mode*, which is *maintained by the Emacs developers* and is less likely to be abandoned like *origami.el* or *yafolding.el*. Since *outline-indent* is based on *outline-minor-mode*, it's also much **much faster** than *origami.el* and *yafolding.el*.

The *outline-indent.el* Emacs package offers a similar functionality to Vim's `set foldmethod=indent` setting. Just as in Vim, it allows to fold and unfold code sections based on their indentation levels.

## Installation

To install *outline-indent* from MELPA:

1. If you haven't already done so, [add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started).

2. Add the following code to your Emacs init file to install *outline-indent* from MELPA:
``` emacs-lisp
(use-package outline-indent
  :ensure t
  :custom
  (outline-indent-ellipsis " ▼ "))
```

## Activation

### Manual activation

Once installed, the minor mode can be activated using:
``` emacs-lisp
(outline-indent-minor-mode)
```

### Automatic activation using hooks

The minor mode can also be automatically activated for a certain mode. For example for Python and YAML:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Python
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
(add-hook 'python-ts-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)

;; YAML
(add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
(add-hook 'yaml-ts-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
```

### Adjusting the shift width and default offset

You can adjust the `outline-indent-shift-width` and `outline-indent-default-offset` according to your preferences. While the default value of 1 is adequate for most modes, setting the appropriate value ensures that the promote and demote functions correctly adjust the indentation of blocks. For example:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Python
(dolist (hook '(python-mode python-ts-mode-hook))
  (add-hook hook #'(lambda()
                     (setq-local outline-indent-default-offset 4)
                     (setq-local outline-indent-shift-width 4))))

;; YAML
(dolist (hook '(yaml-mode yaml-ts-mode-hook))
  (add-hook hook #'(lambda()
                     (setq-local outline-indent-default-offset 2)
                     (setq-local outline-indent-shift-width 2)))
```

Explanation:
1. **Outline Indentation Parameters**:
   - **`outline-indent-default-offset`**: This variable determines the base indentation level for each outline level. It specifies the amount by which each successive outline level should be indented, effectively controlling the visual structure of the outline.
   - **`outline-indent-shift-width`**: This variable determines the number of spaces by which to adjust the indentation when promoting or demoting an indented block with `(outline-indent-shift-right)` and `(outline-indent-shift-left)`.

2. **Why Customize These Values?**:
   - **Language-specific Indentation**: Different programming languages and file formats have different indentation standards. Python typically uses 4 spaces per indentation level, while YAML often uses 2 spaces. Customizing these values for different modes ensures that your outline structure is consistent with the language's indentation practices.
   - **Shift right and shift left**: When you use `outline-indent-shift-left` and `outline-indent-shift-right` functions, these settings control how much the outline level is adjusted. For instance, in Python mode, promoting a block of code (moving it to a higher outline level) will decrease its indentation by 4 spaces, and demoting it will increase its indentation by 4 spaces.

3. **Default Behavior**:
   - By default, `outline-indent-default-offset` is set to 1, which works with any indentation level, as even a single space is enough to fold any indented block using *outline-indent*.
   - By default, `outline-indent-default-shift-width` is `nil`, which means it inherits the value of `outline-indent-default-offset`. If you do not explicitly set `outline-indent-shift-width`, the promote and demote operations will use the same value as the offset. This default behavior works well in many cases, but fine-tuning these values can be necessary for languages or formats with specific indentation needs.

## Usage

### How to check if it is working?

Run the following function to fold all indented blocks:

``` emacs-lisp
(hide-sublevels 1)
```

### Functions specific to outline-indent-minor-mode

#### outline-indent-backward-same-level and outline-indent-forward-same-level

*(By default, `outline-indent-advise-outline-functions` is set to t, which means that you can also use the built-in outline functions `(outline-backward-same-level)` and `(outline-forward-same-level)` as an alternative to `(outline-indent-backward-same-level)` and `(outline-indent-forward-same-level)`)*

To move to the next block with the same indentation level:

``` emacs-lisp
(outline-indent-forward-same-level)
```

To move to the previous block with the same indentation level:

``` emacs-lisp
(outline-indent-backward-same-level)
```

#### outline-indent-shift-left and outline-indent-shift-right

*(By default, `outline-indent-advise-outline-functions` is set to t, which means that you can also use the built-in outline functions `(outline-promote)` and `(outline-demote)` as an alternative to `(outline-indent-shift-left)` and `(outline-indent-shift-right)`)*

These functions can be used to decrease and increase the indentation level of indented blocks.

To increase indentation:
``` emacs-lisp
(outline-indent-shift-right)
```

To decrease indentation:
``` emacs-lisp
(outline-indent-shift-left)
```

The global variable `outline-indent-shift-width` is used to determine the number of spaces to indent or unindent the subtree.

#### outline-indent-move-subtree-up and outline-indent-move-subtree-down

*(By default, `outline-indent-advise-outline-functions` is set to t, which means that you can also use the built-in outline functions `(outline-move-subtree-up)` and `(outline-move-subtree-down)`, as an alternative to `(outline-indent-move-subtree-up)` and `(outline-indent-move-subtree-down)`)*

These functions can be used to move the current subtree down past ARGS headlines of the same level.

To move the subtree down, use:
``` emacs-lisp
(outline-indent-move-subtree-down)
```

To move the subtree up, use:
``` emacs-lisp
(outline-indent-move-subtree-up)
```

#### outline-indent-insert-heading

*(By default, `outline-indent-advise-outline-functions` is set to t, which means that you can also use the built-in outline function `outline-insert-heading` as an alternative to `outline-indent-insert-heading`)*

The `(outline-indent-insert-heading)` function inserts a new line with the same indentation level/depth as the current line just before the next heading that shares the same or less indentation level. It finds the nearest non-empty line with the same or less indentation as the current line and inserts a new line before it.

In `outline-indent-minor-mode`, where most lines are treated as headings, this function is suitable for maintaining consistent indentation within the outline structure. It can be used as an alternative to `outline-insert-heading` to insert content at the same indentation level after the current fold.

Example usage:
``` emacs-lisp
(outline-indent-insert-heading)
```

### Vanilla Emacs

Use the standard `outline-mode`/`outline-minor-mode` commands to fold and unfold sections of your indented file:
- `(hide-sublevels 1)`: Fold all folds.
- `(outline-hide-body)`: Hide all body lines in buffer, leaving all headings visible.
- `(outline-hide-other)`: Hide everything except current body and parent and top-level headings.
- `(outline-hide-entry)`: Hide the body directly following this heading.
- `(outline-hide-leaves)`: Hide the body after this heading and at deeper levels.
- `(outline-hide-subtree)`: Hide everything after this heading at deeper levels.
- `(outline-show-children)`: Show all direct subheadings of this heading.
- `(outline-hide-sublevels)`: Hide everything but the top LEVELS levels of headers, in whole buffer.
- `(outline-show-all)`: Show all of the text in the buffer.
- `(outline-show-entry)`: Show the body directly following this heading.
- `(outline-show-subtree)`: Show everything after this heading at deeper levels.
- `(outline-show-branches)`: Show all subheadings of this heading, but not their bodies.
- `(outline-show-children)`: Show all direct subheadings of this heading.

You can also indent/unindent and move subtree up and down using:

- `(outline-backward-same-level)` and `(outline-forward-same-level)`: Move backward/forward to the indentation level of the current line.
- `(outline-indent-shift-right)` and `(outline-indent-shift-left)`: Indent or unindent the entire subtree.
- `(outline-indent-move-subtree-down)` and `(outline-indent-move-subtree-up)` to move the current subtree up or down.
- `(outline-insert-heading)` to insert a new line with the same indentation level/depth as the current line just before the next heading that shares the same or less indentation level.

Move to the next and previous visible fold:
- `outline-previous-visible-heading`
- `outline-next-visible-heading`

Move forward or backward to the same indentation level:
- `outline-forward-same-level`: Move forward to the same indentation level as the one under the cursor.
- `outline-backward-same-level`: Move backward to the the same indentation level as as the one under the cursor.

### Evil mode

In Evil mode, *outline-indent* works out of the box if you install `evil-collection`, and you can use the Evil and evil-collection keyboard mappings:
- Open fold(s): `zo`, `zO`, `zr`
- Close fold(s): `zc`, `zC`, `zM`
- Toggle folds: `za`
- Next visible fold/heading: `]]` and `[[`
- Move forward/backward to the same indentation level: `gj` and `gk`

You may want to set a few additional key mappings:
```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load "evil"
  (defun my-evil-define-key-outline-indent-minor-mode ()
    ;; Set `M-h` and `M-l` to decrease and increase the indentation level of
    ;; indented blocks
    (evil-define-key 'normal 'local (kbd "M-h") #'outline-indent-shift-left)
    (evil-define-key 'normal 'local (kbd "M-l") #'outline-indent-shift-right)

    ;; Set `M-k` and `M-j` to move indented blocks up and down
    (evil-define-key 'normal 'local (kbd "M-k") #'outline-indent-move-subtree-up)
    (evil-define-key 'normal 'local (kbd "M-j") #'outline-indent-move-subtree-down)

    ;; Set C-<return> to insert a new line with the same indentation
    ;; level/depth as the current line just before the next heading
    (evil-define-key '(normal insert) 'local (kbd "C-<return>")
      (defun my-evil-outline-indent-insert-heading ()
        (interactive)
        (outline-indent-insert-heading)
        (evil-insert-state))))

  (add-hook 'outline-indent-minor-mode-hook #'my-evil-define-key-outline-indent-minor-mode))
```

## Frequently asked questions

### Maintaining blank lines between folded sections

The `outline-blank-line` variable can be set to `t` (true) to maintain blank lines between folded sections, making it easier to distinguish between folds:

``` emacs-lisp
(setq outline-blank-line t)
```

### How to Prevent Emacs from Searching Folded Sections

To prevent Emacs from searching within folded sections, set `search-invisible` to `nil` by adding the following line to your Emacs init file:
```emacs-lisp
(setq-default search-invisible nil)
```

This setting ensures that Emacs skips invisible or folded text during searches, so hidden sections are not included in the search results.

### Why not use origami.el or yafolding?

The `origami.el` and `yafolding.el` package are not reliable method for folding indented code because they are:
- No longer maintained (abandoned),
- Slow,
- Known to have bugs that affect their reliability and performance.

On the other hand, `outline-indent.el` leverages the built-in `outline-minor-mode`, which is:
- Fast,
- Actively maintained by the Emacs developers.

### Why not use folding.el?

The `folding.el` package is no longer maintained (abandoned) and uses markers in the buffer to annotate folds. It does not support using indentation levels to determine foldable sections.

In contrast, `outline-indent.el` uses indentation levels to determine foldable sections.

### How to make Emacs indent new lines based on previous non-blank line?

The following code snippet configures Emacs to indent based on the indentation of the previous non-blank line:
```emacs-lisp
;; This ensures that pressing Enter will insert a new line and indent it.
(global-set-key (kbd "RET") #'newline-and-indent)

;; Indentation based on the indentation of the previous non-blank line.
(setq-default indent-line-function #'indent-relative-first-indent-point)

;; In modes such as `text-mode', pressing Enter multiple times removes
;; the indentation. The following fixes the issue and ensures that text
;; is properly indented using `indent-relative' or
;; `indent-relative-first-indent-point'.
(setq-default indent-line-ignored-functions '())
```

### What other packages can be used to maintain proper indentation in indentation-sensitive programming languages?

#### Displaying vertical indentation guide bars

Choose one of these packages that are available on MELPA:
- highlight-indentation
- highlight-indent-guides

(There is also indent-bars, but it is not yet available on MELPA.)

#### Detecting indentation

The *dtrt-indent* package automatically detects the indentation offset used in source code files and adjusts Emacs settings to match, simplifying the editing of files with varying indentation styles. To install it, add the following to your Emacs init file:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package dtrt-indent
  :ensure t
  :commands (dtrt-indent-global-mode
             dtrt-indent-mode
             dtrt-indent-adapt
             dtrt-indent-undo
             dtrt-indent-diagnosis
             dtrt-indent-highlight)
  :config
  (dtrt-indent-global-mode))
```
